# üìä Capstone Project: Menu Sales Forecasting

## Define the Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to support data-driven decision-making for a restaurant by analyzing historical sales data. By identifying which menu items generate the highest revenue and understanding seasonal or quantity-based trends, we aim to forecast future sales performance. These insights will enable the restaurant to better manage inventory, reduce waste, optimize purchasing decisions, and ensure popular items remain in stock, improving operational efficiency and profitability.

## Model Outcomes or Predictions: 
In this project, I used regression machine learning to forecast revenue generated by individual menu items. The goal was to predict the net price of items sold using historical data, taking into account key factors such as:
‚Ä¢	Quantity sold (top 10)
‚Ä¢	Seasonal trends (daily)
‚Ä¢	Monthly sales performance

By training the model on past transaction data, I was able to generate reliable revenue estimates for future sales scenarios. These predictions support better decision-making around purchasing inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies, helping the business improve operational efficiency and reduce waste.

## Data Acquisition:
I utilized sales dataset covering transactions from 2023 to 2025. The data included key details such as order date, item description, quantity sold, and net price. This dataset provided a strong foundation for identifying high-performing menu items, analyzing seasonal trends, and uncovering patterns in customer purchasing behavior. 

Visualizations below were created to highlight which items contributed most to revenue and during which time periods and insights that are critical for forecasting and strategic planning.

## Data Preprocessing/Preparation
The dataset was cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy and reliability by doing the following:

‚Ä¢	Data Cleaning: I removed voided (canceled) transactions and standardized the price column by converting currency values to numeric format. I also checked for missing or inconsistent entries to avoid errors during modeling. 

‚Ä¢	From the order dates, I extracted new features like Month and Year to help the model recognize seasonal trends.

‚Ä¢	Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into two parts: a training set to teach the model using past data and a test set to evaluate how well it performs on unseen data.






## ü§ñ Modeling
I used two regression models to predict future item-level revenue:
- Linear Regression and Random Forest

## üìä Model Evaluation
I measured model performance using:
- **R¬≤ Score**: to show how much variance is explained by the model
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: to measure prediction error

The Random Forest model outperformed Linear Regression in both metrics and is recommended for ongoing revenue forecasting tasks.

## ‚úÖ Results & Recommendation
- Random Forest provided stronger and more accurate predictions
- Revenue predictions can improve inventory decisions and reduce waste
- Future enhancements can include additional data features (e.g., time of day, promotions, location)
