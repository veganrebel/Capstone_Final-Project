# Capstone Project: Menu Sales Forecasting

## Define the Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to support data-driven decision-making for a restaurant by analyzing historical sales data. By identifying which menu items generate the highest revenue and understanding seasonal or quantity-based trends, we aim to forecast future sales performance. These insights will enable the restaurant to better manage inventory, reduce waste, optimize purchasing decisions, and ensure popular items remain in stock, improving operational efficiency and profitability.

## Model Outcomes or Predictions: 
In this project, I used regression machine learning to forecast revenue generated by individual menu items. The goal was to predict the net price of items sold using historical data, taking into account key factors such as:
‚Ä¢	Quantity sold (top 10)
‚Ä¢	Seasonal trends (daily)
‚Ä¢	Monthly sales performance

By training the model on past transaction data, I was able to generate reliable revenue estimates for future sales scenarios. These predictions will help in better decision-making around purchasing inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies, helping the business improve operational efficiency and reduce waste.

## Data Acquisition:
I utilized sales dataset covering transactions from 2023 to 2025. The data included key details such as order date, item description, quantity sold, and net price. This dataset provided a strong foundation for identifying high-performing menu items, analyzing seasonal trends, and uncovering patterns in customer purchasing behavior. 

Visualizations were created to highlight which items contributed most to revenue and during which time periods and insights that are critical for forecasting and strategic planning.

## Data Preprocessing/Preparation
The dataset was cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy and reliability by doing the following:

‚Ä¢	Data Cleaning: I removed voided (canceled) transactions and standardized the price column by converting currency values to numeric format. I also checked for missing or inconsistent entries to avoid errors during modeling. 

‚Ä¢	From the order dates, I extracted new features like Month and Year to help the model recognize seasonal trends.

‚Ä¢	Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into two parts: a training set to teach the model using past data and a test set to evaluate how well it performs on unseen data.

## Modeling
I used Linear Regression and Random Forrest regression models to predict future item-level revenue:
- Linear Regression - helped identify linear trends in the data useful for baseline relationships between time, quantity sold and price.
-  Random Forest captured the more complex non linear patterns.

## Model Evaluation
Since my goal was to predict revenue values, I used the regression models to evaluat performance. I measured model performance using R¬≤ Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction errors.

The Random Forest model outperformed Linear Regression in both metrics and is recommended for ongoing revenue forecasting tasks.

## Results & Recommendation

Identifying top overall revenue generators: Cali-Bae, Loaded Nachos, El Classico BUrrito, Signature Fries and asada tacos, the restaurant can make more informed decisions around stocking, staffing, and campaign timing to drive growth and reduce waste. Ensuring these top performers can be leveraged for special campaigns during slower months, this can increase foot traffic, increasing sales and customers. 

Future enhancements to the data can include additional features like holidays or special events, allowing a better prediction spikes on certain days. In additoin, data that can determine dine in vs pick-up orders to determine how to staff on certain days would be great.
